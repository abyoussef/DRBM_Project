# Multimodal Deep Boltzmann Machine: 
This is the code of my project joint representation using multimodal Deep Boltzmann Machines. It is realized in the course of Probabilistic Graphical Model and the course Object Recognition and Computer Vision in the MVA Master. 

The goal is to implement a Multi-DBM model with Tensorflow. This is inspired from the [paper]( http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4683-multimodal-learning-with-deep-boltzmann-machines.pdf) of Nitish Srivastava et al appeared at NIPS2012. 

* MDBMCode is an implementation of the Multimodal Deep Boltzmann Machine on the top of [Deep_Learning_Tensorflow](https://github.com/blackecho/Deep-Learning-TensorFlow) library. 

* txtGen is the code for generating tags to images without annotations.
